# CS-300

Problem Description: 
The projects in this course aimed to address various aspects of software development, including understanding data structures and algorithms, designing efficient programs, and practicing good coding practices. In Project One, the focus was on analyzing the runtime and memory usage of different data structures. In Project Two, the objective was to develop a program that loads course data, organizes it using appropriate data structures, and allows users to interact with the data by printing course lists and retrieving course information.

Approach to the Problem: 
In both projects, a systematic approach was necessary. Understanding the problem requirements and constraints, such as runtime and memory efficiency, was crucial. For Project One, analyzing the characteristics of different data structures and their performance in various scenarios was essential. This involved studying the properties of arrays, linked lists, trees, and other structures. For Project Two, the focus shifted to practical implementation, including file I/O, data parsing, and user interaction. Recognizing the importance of data structures was fundamental, as they form the backbone of efficient and organized data management in software systems.

Overcoming Roadblocks: 
During the projects, encountering challenges and obstacles was inevitable. This could include issues with understanding complex algorithms, debugging code, or optimizing performance. To overcome such roadblocks, I leveraged resources such as textbooks, online tutorials, and peer support forums. Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable tasks helped in tackling them systematically. 

Evolution of Approach: 
Working on these projects expanded my approach to software design and development significantly. I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of algorithmic efficiency, code organization, and scalability. Moreover, I learned to appreciate the significance of choosing appropriate data structures and algorithms based on the problem requirements and characteristics. This holistic approach to software development has enabled me to write more robust and efficient programs.

Improving Program Quality: 
Through this project, I have become more cognizant of writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I have adopted coding practices such as meaningful variable names, modular design, and inline documentation to enhance code readability. Furthermore, I have incorporated error handling mechanisms and input validation to improve program reliability. By adhering to these principles, I strive to ensure that my programs are not only functional but also easy to understand and maintain for myself and other developers who may work on them in the future.
